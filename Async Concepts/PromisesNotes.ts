// Certainly! Let's break down the code into detailed explanations:

// 1. **Creating a Promise Object**: 
// ```typescript
let prom = new Promise();
// ```
// - Here, a Promise object named `prom` is created, but without any executor function. This is not a valid way to create a Promise in JavaScript/TypeScript.

// 2. **Defining a Function Inside the Promise Constructor**:
// ```typescript
let prom = new Promise(function () {
});
//```
// - In this line, we create a Promise object `prom` with a function inside the Promise constructor. However, this function does not have any parameters and does not perform any meaningful operation. It's just an empty function.

// 3. **Defining a Function with Resolve and Reject Parameters**:
//```typescript
let prom = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
});
//```
//- Here, we define a function inside the Promise constructor that accepts two parameters: `resolve` and `reject`. These parameters are functions provided by the Promise constructor to handle the fulfillment and rejection of the Promise.

//4. **Example with Resolve and Reject**:
//```typescript
let prom = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
    if (condition) {
        resolve('Success');
    } else {
        reject('Failed');
    }
});


// ```
// - This code demonstrates a typical usage of a Promise, where we perform some asynchronous operation (represented by the `condition`) and then either resolve or reject the Promise based on the result of that operation. If the condition is met, we call `resolve('Success')` to fulfill the Promise with the value `'Success'`. If the condition fails, we call `reject('Failed')` to reject the Promise with the reason `'Failed'`.

// 5. **Defining Functions for Handling Fulfillment and Rejection**:
// ```typescript
let onFulfillment = (result) => {
    console.log(result);
};

let onRejection = (error) => {
    console.log(error);
};
// ```
// - These are the functions that will handle the fulfillment (`onFulfillment`) and rejection (`onRejection`) of the Promise. They are defined as arrow functions that simply log the result or error to the console.

// 6. **Using .then() and .catch() to Handle Fulfillment and Rejection**:
// ```typescript
prom.then(onFulfillment);
prom.catch(onRejection);
// ```
// - Finally, we use the `.then()` method to handle fulfillment and the `.catch()` method to handle rejection of the Promise. When the Promise is resolved successfully (`resolve`), the `onFulfillment` function will be called with the result. If the Promise is rejected (`reject`), the `onRejection` function will be called with the error. These methods allow us to handle the outcome of the Promise asynchronously.
